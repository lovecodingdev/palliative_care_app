That can give everyone some peace of mind.\r\n\r\nWhy is advance care planning important?\r\n\r\nWhatever our age may be, we all have values and preferences related to health and personal care.

Pain can affect every aspect of your life and can often be managed with your health care team. Below are some facts about pain:\r\n\r\n- Not everyone with a life-limiting illness will experience pain  \r\n- Everyone experiences pain differently, so the way you experience pain will be unique to you\r\n- Most pain can be relieved to a level that allows you to continue to live your life\r\n- Pain can be due to different reasons dependant on the cause and therefore it may take more than one type of painkiller(known as an analgesic) to control it\r\n- Pain is not always constant, it can change over the day and with different activities and can fluctuate with your moods, emotions and family life\r\n\r\nHow can pain be managed?\r\n\r\nPain management starts with speaking with your health care professional, such as your GP, your specialist or palliative care team. It is essential that you are honest about your pain so it can be assessed and planned for, for you as an individual. It is also important to remember that your pharmacist is a great resource for information about your pain and other medications. Keeping a diary of when your pain occurs and what makes it worse or better will help with this conversation. \r\n\r\nWith your practitioner, you will have an assessment of your illness and pain and they will develop a pain management plan. This will probably have a mix of non-medicine and medicine based ways to help with your pain. \r\n\r\nWhat are opioid medicines?\r\n\r\nOpioid medicines are pain relievers. They include medicines such as codeine, morphine and oxycodone. Knowing the facts and helping to unravel a few myths, will help you, your family and carers understand opioid medicines. This will help you manage your pain effectively so you can get on with living as well as possible with a life-limiting illness. \r\n\r\nOpioids are medicines that are prescribed for strong or severe pain that is no longer responding to medications of lesser strength. They come in different forms such as tablets, patches or a liquid and your prescriber (e.g. your GP) will discuss which one is best for you and your individual pain treatment. They also help to manage shortness of breath, severe diarrhoea or cough.\r\n\r\nIt is normal when you start taking opioids to use different amounts (known as intermittent dosing) to find the right dose that can cover your pain over a 24 hour period. You may continue to use intermittent dosing so you can still do activities and be more in control of your pain. If you are needing more than 3 intermittent doses every day, you should contact your practitioner to revise your pain management plan. \r\n\r\nRemember always take your medication as prescribed and store as instructed by your pharmacist, and if unsure, ask your practitioner.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please speak with your health care team. For more information please visit the Palliative Care Australia’s website.","link":"http://www.palliativecare.org.au","categories":[]},{"title":"Pain management","image":null,"information_text":"Pain and Pain Management\r\n\r\nWhat is pain?\r\nPain is a message to you that there is distress in your body and can make it hard for you to be active. Pain often accompanies cancer and other progressive diseases and it can affect all aspects of your life.\r\n\r\nWhy are we afraid of pain?\r\nMany people living with a life-limiting illness are afraid of pain because they worry it can’t be controlled without unwanted side effects. It is important to speak up about your pain and ask questions so that you can be given accurate information. \r\n\r\nFearing pain doesn’t make you appear weak\r\nPeople interpret their pain according to their own life experiences, values and beliefs. Sharing your fears about pain with your health care team may reduce your anxiety and provide you with a plan in which to address current or future pain. You may also wish to discuss your fears with a religious leader or a spiritual carer. Everyone’s experience of pain, if present, in a disease is different and often unspoken fears can be worse than the reality. \r\n\r\nCan pain always be controlled?\r\nMost pain can be relieved or controlled. Bringing pain under control means assessing all aspects of pain and monitoring it. These are core skills of palliative doctors and nurses.\r\n\r\nHow is pain controlled? \r\nPain control starts with open communication about what you are experiencing with your health care team. Pain control plans are tailored to meet your particular needs and will be followed up and adjusted as your needs change. A plan may involve a combination of medication and non-medication options. You should always discuss with your health care team if you want less or more pain relief.\r\n\r\nWhen must I take medication?\r\nWhen pain medication is prescribed for you, you must take it on time. Do not wait to experience pain. The schedule is designed to prevent pain from occurring, not to treat it after it arrives since this type of pain tends to be predictable and the level of pain is often able be reduced with pre-emptive dosing.\r\n\r\nWhat about breakthrough pain?\r\nThere may be times you receive pain despite being on regular pain medication. This is called breakthrough pain and can be very distressing for you and your carer. Your practitioner will prescribe additional medication to be taken as needed. Keep a record and talk to your health care team about the amounts you are needing. If extra medication for breakthrough pain has not been prescribed, speak to your General Practitioner or your health care team without delay. Sometimes breakthrough pain means you need an increase in regular medication or a different type of pain medication. The goal of pain management is to prevent pain; it is more difficult to try to control pain once it has occurred. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please speak with your health care team.

Because palliative care is based on individual needs, the services offered will differ but may include:\r\n- Relief of pain and other symptoms (e.g. vomiting, shortness of breath)\r\n- Resources such as equipment needed to aid care at home\r\n- Assistance for families to come together to talk about sensitive issues\r\n- Links to other services such as home help and financial support\r\n- Support for people to meet cultural obligations\r\n- Support for emotional, social and spiritual concerns\r\n- Counselling and grief support\r\n- Referrals to respite care services\r\n- Palliative care is a person and family-centred approach to care, meaning that family and carers can receive practical and emotional support.\r\n\r\nWho is palliative care for?\r\nPalliative care is for people of any age who have been told that they have an illness that cannot be cured. This includes: advanced cancer, motor neurone disease, end-stage kidney or lung disease. \r\n\r\nFor some people, palliative care is beneficial from the time of diagnosis with a serious life-limiting illness and can be provided alongside treatments given by other health care teams to help improve quality of life and support their symptoms.\r\n\r\nWho is in the palliative care team?\r\nPalliative care may be provided by a wide range of people, this may include your GP, aged care worker, cardiologist and any other health care provider, as well as family and other carers.  They may be supported by specialist palliative care services if symptoms become difficult to manage.\r\n\r\nWhere is palliative care provided?\r\nPalliative care is provided where the person and their family wants, where possible. This may include in their home, in a hospital or a hospice.\r\n\r\nMany people indicate a preference to die at home and making this possible often depends on several factors, including:\r\n- The nature of the illness and amount of care the person needs\r\n- How much support is available from the person’s family and community\r\n- Whether the person has someone at home who can provide physical care and support for them\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please speak with your health care team.

Bringing pain under control means assessing all aspects of pain and monitoring it.\r\n\r\nMyth: Palliative care is only available in the last few days before you die.\r\nFact: Palliative care should be available for people when they are diagnosed with a life-limiting illness that is likely to cause their death. People can receive palliative care for a long time before they die, and may receive it at the same time as they receive treatment aimed at a cure.\r\n\r\nMyth: You can only receive palliative care in a hospital.\r\nFact: Palliative care can be provided in many places, including a hospital, at home, a hospice and a residential aged care facility (nursing home).\r\n\r\nMyth: receiving palliative care means you will die more quickly.\r\nFact: Palliative care aims to provide the best quality of life until the person dies. Early access to palliative care may help people to live longer than if they didn’t receive palliative care. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please speak with your health care team.

Grief is a normal response to loss and it can affect every part of our lives and it will vary for each person. Grieving can last a long time, and for many, may not come to an end, but it may help to know that your grief will become less raw over time. You will never forget or stop missing the person who has died, but in time, you become better at living with the loss.\r\n\r\nWhat can grief feel like?\r\nWhile painful, grief is a normal expected process that can include a range of reactions and changes in our feelings, behaviours, beliefs and bodies\r\n\r\nFeelings – People may experience intense feelings such as shock, sadness, anger, and anxiety. \r\n\r\nBehaviours – People may experience lethargy or overactivity, sleep a lot or resort to alcohol and other potentially harmful behaviours.\r\n\r\nPhysical reactions – Grief can lead to physical symptoms such as insomnia, tiredness and loss of appetite. \r\nBeliefs – People’s beliefs about life may be challenged. Often grieving people wonder why this has happened to them.\r\n\r\nHow do we grieve?\r\nEveryone grieves in their own way and it is important to remember that there is no right way or time to grieve. \r\n\r\nMembers of the same family will grieve in their own way. Some people want to express their grief through crying and talking. Others may be reluctant to talk and prefer to keep busy. \r\n\r\nIt is important to respect each other’s way of grieving.\r\n\r\nHelping yourself\r\nBeing a carer for someone with a life-limiting illness can be exhausting. After the person has died, you may find it very difficult to go back to work or do things that you previously enjoyed. \r\n\r\nWhen you are grieving it is important to look after yourself, this may include:\r\n- Doing something to honour the person who has died\r\n- Getting as much rest as possible\r\n- Giving yourself permission to grieve and be happy\r\n- Giving yourself time to talk and share your feelings\r\n\r\nClose friends and family members may be a good source of support, this may include\r\n- Allow people to help you\r\n- Talk to family and friends and share memories \r\n- Join a community-based support group\r\n\r\nHelping others\r\nNothing can take the pain and sadness away but knowing that people care can provide comfort and support. Some things that may help:\r\n- Acknowledge the death and express your care\r\n- Keep in touch and be available to listen\r\n- Help in practical ways\r\n- Remember that sometimes people will want to talk and sometimes they won’t\r\n\r\nSometimes, there are things that are not helpful, these might include:\r\n- Changing the subject\r\n- Taking anger personally \r\n- Making comments which suggest blame or fault\r\n\r\nIf you are really worried about someone, ask them if they are doing okay. \r\n\r\nFeeling overwhelmed?\r\nSometimes we may need to seek help. Grief is a normal and inevitable part of life, but for some people it can be very distressing. If it becomes too much, professional help is recommended. Your GP can refer you to an appropriate service.\r\n\r\nSeveral organisations provide information or telephone counselling, including:\r\nAustralian Centre for Grief and Bereavement: 1800 642 066\r\nLifeline (24/7): 13 11 14\r\nKids Helpline (24/7): 1800 55 1800\r\nMensline (24/7): 1300 78 99 78\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please speak with your health care team.

For some clinicians this however can come at a cost to themselves and potentially, their personal relationships. It is important for clinicians to be aware of their own vulnerabilities, triggers, stress and compassion fatigue, and develop coping mechanisms to try and avoid burning out. Self-awareness is essential for the person themselves to monitor changes in their health and how this effects those around them such as their families, colleagues and patients. Therefore, people may undertake their own periodic self-reflection to gauge where they are at or to reflect on feedback from family or colleagues indicating they may need to consider their current resilience.</p><p></p><p>There are times in most clinicians careers that self-reflection alone may not be enough. Often support can be as simple an informal discussion with a colleague but support can also be found in more formalised discussions such as case debriefs, mentoring and clinical supervision to aid self-reflection and increase resilience. Most organisations will have internal policies and procedures in place to support staff wellbeing and care. Some may also have formal arrangements in place for staff to access external services for counselling and debriefing, which may have particular relevance following a distressing or problematic experience. These can be accessed through most Human Resources or Staff Health Departments.</p><p></p><p>Outside of their organisation there are alternatives that clinicians can access such as:</p><p></p><ul><li>Speak with their own General Practitioner about what support may be available.</li><li>Contact the CRANAplus’ Bush Support Service for 24-hour/7-day phone counselling for rural and remote health practitioners on 1800 805 391.</li><li>Contact the Doctors Health Advisory Service in your state or territory 24-hours/7-days – refer to the website for contact details http://www.adhn.org.au/</li><li>Contact the RACGP GP Support Program (for RACGP members) by calling 1300 361 008 (Office hours are 8.30 am to 6.00 pm Monday to Friday) or 1300 361 008 (24 hours/7 days) for crisis counselling.</li><li>Access the RACGP GP Self-care resource available at here</li></ul>","featured_image_full":{"url":"/media/images/looking-after-155.original.png","width":165,"height":155},"featured_image_1200":{"url":"/media/images/looking-after-155.width-1200.png","width":165,"height":155},"featured_image_600":{"url":"/media/images/looking-after-155.width-600.png","width":165,"height":155},"read_more_url":"http://www.palliativecare.org.au/im-a-health-professional"}],"about_this_app":[{"title":"About this app","body":"<p>Palliative Care Australia (PCA) is undertaking a two year project to support rural and remote Australians to discuss their end-of-life wishes – the Dying to Talk in the Bush project.
